Zapy Zaphod
===========

My first attempt at a 5-column layout (for the Zaphod keyboard) tried to keep TAB,
CTRL and SHIFT on the left column, and another SHIFT on the bottom-right, so I could
keep using CTRL at the spot I was used to (because emacs), and I could keep using
space cadet shift (hold = shift, tap = parentheses).

To be able to do this I moved the Z and A keys to their new spot before P and Y, hence
"Zapy Zaphod".

HT edition
==========

The Zapy layout was rather difficult to get used to, so for the current version I
switched it back to normal Dvorak.

Zapy Zaphod HT uses Hold-Tap behaviours to keep CTRL and SHIFT on the keys I am used
to.  CMD and OPT are moved to the JK and MW keys, almost like homerow mods, but I
don't want to put them on the homerow to avoid messing with the key repeat of cursor
movement.
